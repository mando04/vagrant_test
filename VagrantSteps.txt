# The location to vagrant will vary depending on where you installed vagrant
/usr/bin/vagrant init http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/centos-64-x64-vbox4210.box

# a few modifications we need to make to Vagrantfile (if not already done)
# find the following line and uncoment it
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
  to 
    config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
