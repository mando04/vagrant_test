# Semi Manual setup
# Create a dev directory (optional)

# The location to vagrant will vary depending on where you installed vagrant
/usr/bin/vagrant init http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/centos-64-x64-vbox4210.box

# a few modifications we need to make to Vagrantfile (if not already done)
# find the following line and uncoment it
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
  to 
    config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
#that will allow us to access the vm through that IP

#Modify this part in Vagrantfile
  config.vm.provision "chef_solo" do |chef|
    chef.cookbooks_path = "./cookbooks"
    chef.add_recipe "nginx"
    chef.formatter = :doc
  end
# Make sure your Vagrantfile is in the same directory as your cookbooks directory which holds the nginx cookbook

# now lets bring up the box and provision it with chef-solo
vagrant up --provision
